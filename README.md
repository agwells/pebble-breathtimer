==================

A simple [Pebble watch](https://getpebble.com/) app for a timed breathing exercise.

To try to help with my [chronic hyperventilation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperventilation_syndrome), I've been doing this breathing exercise twice daily. You simply breath gently in for 7 seconds, then breath gently out for 11 seconds. Continue for 5 minutes.

I often lost count while doing this, and I found it tedious to have to watch my stopwatch the whole time, so I made this app to assist me. In addition to big friendly "IN" and "OUT" on the watchface, a short buzz tells you it's time to start inhaling and a long buzz tells you it's time to start exhaling. When the five minutes have elapsed, after the last exhale the screen will say "DONE" and there will be a double-buzz.

The app is not currently configurable or controllable in any way. You simply launch it to begin the five minutes, and quit it once you're done.
