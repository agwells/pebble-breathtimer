==================

A simple Pebble app for a timed breathing exercise. To try to help with my chronic hyperventilation, I've been doing a breathing exercise twice daily, where for 5 minutes you alternate between inhaling for 7 seconds and exhaling for 11 seconds. I found it tedious to have to stare at my stopwatch the whole 5 minutes, and I often lost count, so this app helps prevent that. A short buzz tells you to inhale; a long buzz tells you to exhale; a double buzz tells you the five minutes are up.
